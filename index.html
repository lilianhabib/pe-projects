					<h2 id="about">About</h2>
						<p>I was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, and I now live in Vancouver, British Columbia. I graduated with my Bachelor of Technology and Minor in Marketing from Ryerson University. After working as a Structural Designer at a packaging company, I pursued my Bachelor of Education at Ontario Tech University. I currently work at a local private school as an elementary school teacher. My teaching experiences brought to light an issue. Many teachers and students do not have any experience with technology, and it was even more clear that many would have benefited from it. One of the biggest barriers is the lack of teachers with the necessary confidence and understanding of technology. The entire education system needed reform from the ground up, so I thought the best way to reform the system was to learn more about technology. That was when I decided to pursue development. My hope is to use my experiences to change classroom pedagogies and B.C.â€™s education system to be inclusive of technology.</p>
