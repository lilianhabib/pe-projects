	<p>My passion for teaching and technology began early in my education. As someone with unilateral hearing loss, I really struggled to learn in a traditional classroom, but with the help of technology and supportive teachers, I was able to overcome many of the diversities one might face with hearing loss. Understanding the impact my teachers had on my educational journey inspired me at the age of seven to want to help those like me and many others to succeed.

	Several years later, I enrolled in the Graphic Communications Management (GCM) program at Ryerson University. This program is unique because it is Canada’s only degree that teaches the printing industry. In these four years, I learned about web development, photography, typography, printing, pre-press, post-press, packaging, design, business, management, and so much more. During my time at GCM, I realized that there was so much more to technology than giant overhead projectors, tube TV, and my hearing aid. There is so much a person can design, communicate, and explore with technology that I only discovered years later – the possibilities really are endless.

	I earned my Bachelor's in Technology and a minor in Marketing. I worked as a Structural Designer for a company in Toronto. After some time, I proceeded to get my teaching certificate at Ontario Tech University.

	During my time at Ontario Tech University, I was able to learn about technology within the scope of the classroom, which further broadened my understanding of it. Out of the many technologies I learned, coding stood out the most, having immediately captured my attention. That said, when I was first introduced to web development at GCM, I absolutely hated it. Nonetheless, I kept an open mind the second time around. When learning was remote, I used Scratch and Scratch Jr. with my students and it was amazing what my students in Grade 1 could create; the level of engagement and understanding of the subject matter significantly improved. Students who had shorter attention spans who did not typically participate created amazing projects. Coding, along with other technology resources, allow for the creation of tools which widen the range of different ways to learn, empowering educators to better accommodate their students.

	Fast forward to today, I am an elementary school teacher at my local school, working with students of all ages and abilities. My experience with coding has ignited a deeper passion for it, so I want to continue to broaden my knowledge of it to reform British Columbia’s education system through its integration. After many months of research, I decided to enroll in Perpetual Education - Design for the Web.</p>
