It also gives me a platform to share my work, web developement journey, thoughts, and ideas with a wider audience. <br><br> While maintaining a minimalistic design, I've added pops of color, box shadows, and rounded borders to reflect my fun and playful personality. I believe that having fun is not only important in the workplace, but also in life. <br><br>A minimalistic design can complement the professionalism of a website by highlighting the most important information without overwhelming the reader. It can also make the site easier to navigate and understand.",
