When I did come across one and found a comfy quiet corner spot, I was told that they did not offer wifi. This is common with many cafes in the city because they want to maximize and increase turnover. I don't believe I was the only one who encountered this issue. Java Finder help users find a cafe that is meets their needs and wants. If users need wifi or want blue mountain coffee, Java Finder is the place to go. The future of Java Finder is to work with cafes across multiple cities. Information such available seats and wifi availability are unique to Java Finder. I aim to create a website and app that is simple, easy to use and navigate across all devices.",

I found that the apps and websites designs had at least one supplementary colour that complemented the overall colours of the website. Additionally, the apps and websites were simple and clean, so that was something I wanted to emulate.",

I was mesmorized by the shinny packaging and immediate 'glow' they would get after applying Urbran Decay eye shadow. Beauty has always been a big part of my childhood, so when I was tasked with a challenge to create a website with a specific theme, I immediately gravitated towards beauty. Within beauty, I wanted to specifically focus on eco-friendly natural skin care products because I believe that what you put in and on your body should not only be good for us but also for the environment. This project replicates similar layouts as many current e-commerce sites -- a call-to-action, article, product showcase, and collection. It was also important to me to make the layout repsonsive across multiple devices. I hope to continue updating my site to make it more accessible for users of all abilities.",
