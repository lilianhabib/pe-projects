When I did come across one and found a comfy quiet corner spot, I was told that they did not offer wifi. This is common with many cafes in the city because they want to maximize and increase turnover. I don't believe I was the only one who encountered this issue. The future of Java Finder is to work with cafes across multiple cities so users are able to find a cafe that meets their needs. Information such available seats and wifi availability are unique to Java Finder. I aim to create a website and app that is simple, easy to use and navigate across all devices.",

I found that the apps and websites designs had at least one supplementary colour that complemented the overall colours of the website. Additionally, the apps and websites were simple and clean, so that was something I wanted to emulate.",
