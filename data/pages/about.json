I have more than 10 years of experience in elementary education and 2 years of experience working in the printing and technology industry. <br> <br> While under the mentorship at Perpetual Education - Design for the Web, I am continuing my love for teaching at my local elementary school. I hope to work for a company that strives towards bettering education. <br> <br>When I am not teaching or building websites, you can find me on a hike, in the kitchen cooking a new one-pot recipe, catching up on the latest Netflix series, exploring the city through food, working on a puzzle, or walking through Costco's aisle.",
