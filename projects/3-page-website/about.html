					<p>Hello! I'm Lilian. I was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, and now lives in Vancouver, British Columbia. I graduated with her Bachelor of Technology and Minor in Marketing from Ryerson University. I worked as a Structural Designer at a packaging company after graduating. In 2019, I pursued my Bachelor of Education from Ontario Tech University. I currently work at a local private school as an elementary school teacher. My teaching experience brought to light an issue in the school system. It was clear that many students did not have any experience with technology, and it was even more clear that many students would have benefited from it. One of the biggest barriers is the lack of teachers with the necessary confidence and understanding of technology. The entire education system needed reform from the ground up, so I thought the best way to reform the system was to learn more about technology. That was when I decided to pursue development. My hope is to use my experiences to change classroom pedagogies and B.C.â€™s education system to be inclusive of technology.</p>
