## Lesson Notes
**Video 1**
* In your mood boards, change how they might relate to each other - creating contrast between images and creating a juxtaposition 
* Create different-sized images 
* Big areas of colour or space to contrast depth 
* Use the contrast of size, shape, colours, and space to develop some magic

Challenge: Select a couple of images from your mood board and change how they relate to each other. Reorganize those images based on size, colour, shape, style, pattern, and depth. Think about how you might want to organize the space around those images. Provide an opinion on the design choices you have made. 


**Video 2** 
Challenge: Use shapes and play with the space, transparency, colour, position, and size of the elements. Experiment with positioning different sized elements in the corner, on top of each other, beside each other, and far or close to each other. Design decisions should have a purpose, reason, and consistency so you can confidently sell your ideas to the client.

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
**Typography Guide**
1. Flush Left 
  * Set your flush left rag right because, in western culture, people read from top to bottom, left to right. Eyes naturally follow this flow. Avoid indenting the first line. 

2. Use One Typeface 
  * Avoid using two typefaces. Using two requires an understanding of the chosen faces so you can be confident that they are complementary
  * Avoid using two typefaces of the same classification. Do not use two sans serif, serif, slab serif, or script faces together. The reason is contrast. 

3. Skip a Weight  
* The key to design is contrast. So go from light to bold or from medium to extra bold. Slight changes in weight change make it harder for the audience to notice the difference 
* Try mixing bold for the headline and light for the body 

4. Double Point Size
* A good rule of thumb when changing point sizes is to double or half the point size you are using. For example, if you are using 30 pt for the headline, use 15 pt for the body. 
For other uses, use 3x or 4x the point size for something more dramatic 

5. Align to One Axis 
*Build your type along one primary axis and align the element to this grid line. For a vertical axis, align the left edge of your type. This will work regardless of font type or size. For the horizontal axis, align on the strongest horizontal element.

6. Pick any Typeface
* Akzidenz Grotesk, Avenir, Avant Garde, Baskerville, Bembo, Bodoni, Bookman, Caslon, Century, Clarendon, Courier, DIN, Franklin Gothic, Frutiger, Futura, Garamond, Gill Sans, Gotham, Helvetica, Letter Gothic, Memphis, Meta, Mrs. Eaves, OCRB, Rockwell, Sabon, Times New Roman, Trade Gothic, Trajan, and Univers.

7. Group by Using Rules 
* Use rules/lines to group related blocks of information. This will also make dissimilar objects appear more orderly. 

8. Avoid the corners 
* Don’t place elements along the edge or corners of a page unless to deliberately cut elements off. Negative space is a good thing 

9. Mind the Gap 
*Typography is all about spacing. Never force justify type because of the inherent rivers that it’ll create. 
* Avoid having a single word on the last line of a paragraph, otherwise known as a widow. 
* Don’t allow a new page or column to begin with the final word or line from a previous paragraph, therefore, separating it from the rest of its paragraph - known as orphan
* Use a single space after punctuation in a sentence. Pay attention to the shape the rag creates to avoid undesired shapes/angles 
* Spacing matters. The closer things are together, the more the reader will assume a relationship exists between separate blocks of information 

10. Relax, it’s just type 
* Be bold or italic, never regular - this is not an actual rule. It is a way to govern your life. Now that you’ve learned the rules, break it 


###Chris and Milka’s critique Takeaways 
* Be intentional about spacing! Creating small, medium, and large white spaces creates good contrast. You don’t have to have the size of the space in order, mix it up! This helps create hierarchy. Also, make sure the size of the space is distinguishable. 
* If the text is left aligned and ragged right, you want to be aware of the length of the lines. It is best to have short and long lines alternate. 
* Our eyes usually go to the darkest element on the page. The darkest element is typically the most important. Then the second most important is not as dark and the least important is the lightest. You want to create a hierarchy and have the elements interact using different font weights.

## Lesson Notes
- Codepen of the website remake: https://codepen.io/lilianhabib/pen/MWGeZaE 
- This layout reminded me of one of the layouts in Chris and Milka’s critique. The S-bottle logo is positioned at the top left of the web page, which immediately catches the users' attention because it is the boldest element and it is positioned where the eyes are naturally drawn to. Then the eyes are drawn to the image and then the menu. I like that the elements force the users’ eyes to travel around the page. 

- The menu seems like it was positioned arbitrarily relative to the logo because it is neither positioned at the top, middle, or bottom of the logo area. But, was it supposed to be positioned relative to the logo? I think that if it was properly aligned with the logo, it would have created a better flow and symmetry. 

- Just below the menu is the second boldest element on the web page. The designer could have put “pure” in the first line, but that would have caused “water” to be a widow. 

- Under the bold text is a short paragraph. It looks pretty small in comparison to the text above it. I wonder if reducing the font size by half would have visually looked better. I think that the difference in font sizes is too significant and, therefore, there isn’t harmony between the two sets of text. 

- The font size for the contact button looks bigger than the paragraph, but that could be because it is in uppercase letters. 

- The space between the three main elements on the right side of the page isn’t equal, but it is close to being the same pixels. I believe they should have put the effort to make the space equal to create consistency. 

- In regards to space, I do see a difference between large, medium, and small. Milka talked about the importance of creating different lengths of space to create a dynamic layout. I like that the space isn’t positioned chronologically from small to large because otherwise, it wouldn’t seem natural. 

- I think that the contrast between the background colour and text could be better. It is difficult to read the white text on a light blue background. 


## conclusion / major takeaways? 
- Be intentional about spacing and constrast. Both work together to create cohesive. However, sometimes, the spacing won't make sense (i.e. spacing between elements are only a few pixels off) because spacing it created based on the length of the box/words/paragraph.

##Lesson 083: Visual Language Intro 

###Standup 
**Yesterday**
* Completed day 3 of TAD 
* Worked on researching and analyzing a website 

**Today**
* Post day 3 of TAD
* Finalize the research and employ exercise 
* Get started on today's lesson 

No blockers 

Have a great day! 

## Lesson Notes
**Website elements** 
* Name 
* Biography/About page

* images/thumbnail of projects 
* Logo 
* Resume 
* Picture of yourself 


## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Style tiles are a great way to combine all of the elements for the website and present it to the client. It wouldn't be efficient to create an entire website for each iterations. 
* You want the client to be with you at every stage while designing a website 
* Creating different iterations increases client buy-ins - iteractions can easily be completed be done with style tiles

Have a great day! 

## Lesson Notes
* I didn’t know anything about Santa Fe, New Mexico. So when I Googled the location, I found some similarities between the photos. I collected the photos I really liked in affinity designer. I compared the photos and found that there’s a lot of beige/brown coloured architecture, so I wanted to incorporate that as it seems common in this area. After some time, I narrowed it down to two photos and decided to combine the photos in the red box into a postcard. I wanted to incorporate the photo of the gate because it gives a welcoming and warm feeling. I wanted to capture the beauty of Santa Fe by incorporating the coloured sky, trees, and architecture.  

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Design is fun!! 
* Letting go of my own expectations and letting the design just happen!

## Lesson 087: Store style tile  

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? I was originally creating documents with my notes and uploading them to GitHub, but after speaking with Derek, I have learned how to complete journals directly in GitHub, which is so much easier. I might have misunderstood the instructions. I also reviewed the standup resource again. Not sure what took me so long to adopt this framework, but I'll be formating these standups like this from now on. 
* What is something that was confusing? Or an idea you had? Navigating GitHub is still  confusing. I am still figuring out all of the buttons and options available. 
* Is there anything you need help with today? 
* Is there anything you are excited to learn? I am excited to explore some common UX patterns/components and make a style tile with some of these components. If there is time, I am hoping to learn about DeployBot. 

No blockers 

Have a great day! 

## Lesson Notes
* Today was a challenge day so no lesson notes. 
 
## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* I am beginning to see the value in brainstorming and researching. Typically, I get impatient and I start designing without having any goals or starting point. This often causes a lot of stress and frustration as I am deleting, adding, and rearranging things. In the past couple of design challenges, I opened the design programs not to design something but to brainstorm and gather some ideas. I personally think brainstorming and researching have led to some designs I was actually satisfied with, which might mean that design could be in my future. This doesn't mean I'll create amazing designs all the time. It just means that I'll be less anxious about design and can go into it with a clear mind. 



## 09.22.2022 
## Lesson 088: Symbol and Icon Exploration   

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? I learned how to set up DeployBot and connect it to GitHub and server. I also learned about common UX patterns among various websites and applied those patterns to a style tile for a company’a website 

* What is something that was confusing? In a one of the channels, Derek mentioned to "keep content and layout separate with components that are independent of the page structure (ie inner-columns)". What does it mean to “keep content and layout separate" and "independent of the page structure"? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? I am excited to learn about  and design symbols and icons that all fit together 

* Blockers: going to have limited access to the internet until Saturday. Also, Slack is being weird on my laptop, so might not be able to upload today’s lesson by end of day. 


## Lesson Notes
* I create a set of icons today. The words selected were not related, but I had to somehow create some cohesiveness between them. I decided to stick to a yellow and white colour theme and use mostly simple shapes to create the images.
* Midway through this assignment, doubt started to set in. I hadn't felt this in the past few challenges - I've been confident with every design step I've taken. I thought I was doing it wrong and I did not think that my icons represented the words at all. I put a stop to those thoughts right away and reminded myself that not every design decision it going to be a good one. If I did it wrong, then that is great! I'll post it, get feedback, and make the proper changes. Having this internal dialogue with myself about whether the assignment is good enough or if I am doing it right, is not the best approach. Always get help and opinion from others. Often, my thoughts are biased and not always entirely accurate. 
 
## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Ask for help and opinion about my work before scratching the entire design. There might be some value in creating something different.

## Lesson 092: PHP Templates

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned over the weekend? The entire Friday and weekend was write off for me as I was getting back home. I did work on my site and finalize it, but I did not learn anything new.  

* What is something that was confusing? I did not find anything confusing  

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today, I am excited to get a better understanding of PHP templates and create a Mad Lib challenge. Also, I am hoping to finalize the others pages on my website. 

* Blockers: I am still trying to get my body back to a normal sleep schedule - it's been harder than I thought it would be. 


## Lesson Notes
* Delimiter: A character that marks the beginning or end of a unit of data. In PHP, I'll be using <?php?> to start and end PHP.
* Concatenation: combine or join together (ex: airplane/air-plane). In PHP, you'll be joining strings together. For example, grabbing a first and last name from a databse and smooshing them together to form a greeting. 
* PHP is like an HTML document with some PHP in it. It is like the style tag within an HTML.
* Inside the quotes are strings of different characters, symbols and numbers 
* We can complete math equations 
* We can assign references to the different strings  
* Other ways to comment PHP in a paragraph, so use PHP in HTML: 
		
		<?php echo $variable; ?> 

		<?=$variable?> 
  


 
## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Today was fun and confusing all at the same time. I enjoyed learning about PHP and seeing how it can be used. I created a MadLibs activity and used PHP to fill in the blanks. I wrote the paragraph in <?php ?> and used echo to push the code onto the webpage. Then I tried php in HTML. There are two ways to write PHP in HTML. I tried both and found that it was much easier than the PHP method. When I uploaded it to the server, that was when things got challening. I spent some time figuring it out andI couldn't. But with Derek's help, I did the process of elimination and removed the math equation and that seems to have fixed the issue! Bt also... take. things. slow. I need to pratice this. I don't know if it is  excitement or lack of patience or both. 




## 09.27.2022 
## Lesson 093: Control Flow

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned over the yesterday? Yesterday I learned more about PHP and completed a MadLibs challenge. I ran into a HTTP 500 error after uploading it to the server. It took a while to figure out, but got it to work. I praticed PHP before the day ended and ran into the same HTTP 500 error. I realized that I forgot a few semi-colons and quotations. I also finalized all of the pages for my site (except the resume page) and updated the server. 

* What is something that was confusing? I did not find anything confusing  

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today, I am excited go over some terms and dive into else, if, and elseif statments. I am also going to go over yesterday lesson again for more practice. 

* Blockers: None!

## Lesson Notes
* Today we practiced some PHP control flow statements (else, elseif, and if). It reminded me of JS when I was learning on my own. I did run into some HTTP 500 error because I was putting a condition on the last else statement. I put a conditioned on the if and elseif statements and echoed a comment for the last else statement.
* Key words 
* * Delimiter: A character or set of characters that separate some text from other text. A comma, tags, quotes
* * Keyword: a reserved word that the language and the interpreter have already defined. 
* * Statement: explicit instruction. A comman you write. When you use the assignment operator, do math, or concatenate some strings, you are writing statements. 
* * Operator: a symbol that tells the PHP interpreter to perform certain actions. 
* * Boolean: value is true or false. 

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* As I was practicing writing <?php echo $animal;?> and <?=$animal?> statements in paragraphs, I forgot the semi-colons again when assigning a value to the variable! Don't forget the semi-colon! Look over things carefully!! 


## 09.28.2022 
## Lesson 094: PHP Arrays and Objects + some HSL color

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned over the yesterday? Yesterday, I learned about else, elseif and else statements. I practiced it several times and learned that the else statement doesn't need a condition. When I did add one, it resulted in a HTTP 500 error. I went over the MadLibs activity again and I kept forgetting those semi-colons. Spent about 5-10 minutes figuring out what I was doing wrong. Practiced it several times more after that and I think I am getting the the hang of it, but I'm going to practice it again today. I also unexpectedly spent majority of my evening fixing my site. The menu and paragraph for two of the pages overflowed, while the others didn't (i.e. home and project page). Not sure why because I used the home page's html and css as a template for all of the pages. The navigation bar overflowing was most confusing. I went over the code line by line and it was exactly the same as the home page's. However, when I copied the nav css (from the home page) to the other page, it magically fixed the issue. I don't know if it was some sort of glitch. Also recently, my logo disappears and I see another logo. Only when I refresh the page several times, I see my original logo. Weird.

* What is something that was confusing? Other than the website issue, there are no confusions! 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today, I am excited to learn about some PHP arrays and objects and play around with HSL colour

* Blockers: None!

## Lesson Notes
* An array is a data structure to organize lists of things. It has an intrinsic order to it. 
* Instead of asscessing the array with numbers, you can write echo $cat["nameokeyvalue"];. 
* Arrays has an intrinsic order, so you need to called $example[2]. The list starts at 0. 
* The Value Song: 
* * adding black to a colour creates a shade. 
* * adding white to a colour creates a tint. 
* * grey - when you mix white and black. Add grey to a colour and you create a tone 
* * value is the lightness or darkness of colour of hue

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Major takeaway today is use only one CSS styles page for all web pages. Always remember quotations and commas, and symbols. 


## 09.29.2022 
## Lesson 095: Loops and Iteration

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned over the yesterday? Yesterday I learned about arrays and objects and HSL. I checked my site's colour contrast. I didn't pass with the original colours, but passed the second time around with different colours. I also combined all css style pages into one. Nothing looks broken so far!

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? I am looking forward to learning about loops and iteration. After meeting with Derek, I have a better understanding of how to navigate git. I will also be applying CSS variables to my css and completing some milstone PHP challenges. 

* Blockers: None!

## Lesson Notes
* There are so many things I've learned today! It's exciting. So if thre are 5 items in the $fruitArray ($fruitsArray = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherries", "Date", "Elderberry"]). Then I'll use 'foreach'. (foreach 9$fruitArray as $fruit) { echo "li" . $fruit . "/li"; }). So what this means is that for each item in the $fruitArray call it $fruit and then echo each $fruit item in a list. 
* I created a monster adoption website using PHP! But it was confusing! I need more practice. I need to study each section to understand it better. I also think formatting is another thing I need to master, but that will come with practice. 
## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* foreach statement will called each item/run a block of code for each item. It'll also identify each item as a new variable. Then it'll do what you ask it to do i.e. create a list.  
* Also! USE STYLE TILE TO TEST OUT IDEAS FIRST THEN CODE IT.
