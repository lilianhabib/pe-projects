**Today**
* Reorganize my mood board and experiment with shapes, space, and colour
* Practice responsive layout and add it to my garden
* Create a responsive layout webpage 
* Post my article 
* Start a new thing-a-day 
* Revise my goals 

No blockers 

Have a great day! 

## Lesson Notes
**Video 1**
* In your mood boards, change how they might relate to each other - creating contrast between images and creating a juxtaposition 
* Create different-sized images 
* Big areas of colour or space to contrast depth 
* Use the contrast of size, shape, colours, and space to develop some magic

Challenge: Select a couple of images from your mood board and change how they relate to each other. Reorganize those images based on size, colour, shape, style, pattern, and depth. Think about how you might want to organize the space around those images. Provide an opinion on the design choices you have made. 


**Video 2** 
Challenge: Use shapes and play with the space, transparency, colour, position, and size of the elements. Experiment with positioning different sized elements in the corner, on top of each other, beside each other, and far or close to each other. Design decisions should have a purpose, reason, and consistency so you can confidently sell your ideas to the client.

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
**Typography Guide**
1. Flush Left 
  * Set your flush left rag right because, in western culture, people read from top to bottom, left to right. Eyes naturally follow this flow. Avoid indenting the first line. 

2. Use One Typeface 
  * Avoid using two typefaces. Using two requires an understanding of the chosen faces so you can be confident that they are complementary
  * Avoid using two typefaces of the same classification. Do not use two sans serif, serif, slab serif, or script faces together. The reason is contrast. 

3. Skip a Weight  
* The key to design is contrast. So go from light to bold or from medium to extra bold. Slight changes in weight change make it harder for the audience to notice the difference 
* Try mixing bold for the headline and light for the body 

4. Double Point Size
* A good rule of thumb when changing point sizes is to double or half the point size you are using. For example, if you are using 30 pt for the headline, use 15 pt for the body. 
For other uses, use 3x or 4x the point size for something more dramatic 

5. Align to One Axis 
*Build your type along one primary axis and align the element to this grid line. For a vertical axis, align the left edge of your type. This will work regardless of font type or size. For the horizontal axis, align on the strongest horizontal element.

6. Pick any Typeface
* Akzidenz Grotesk, Avenir, Avant Garde, Baskerville, Bembo, Bodoni, Bookman, Caslon, Century, Clarendon, Courier, DIN, Franklin Gothic, Frutiger, Futura, Garamond, Gill Sans, Gotham, Helvetica, Letter Gothic, Memphis, Meta, Mrs. Eaves, OCRB, Rockwell, Sabon, Times New Roman, Trade Gothic, Trajan, and Univers.

7. Group by Using Rules 
* Use rules/lines to group related blocks of information. This will also make dissimilar objects appear more orderly. 

8. Avoid the corners 
* Don’t place elements along the edge or corners of a page unless to deliberately cut elements off. Negative space is a good thing 

9. Mind the Gap 
*Typography is all about spacing. Never force justify type because of the inherent rivers that it’ll create. 
* Avoid having a single word on the last line of a paragraph, otherwise known as a widow. 
* Don’t allow a new page or column to begin with the final word or line from a previous paragraph, therefore, separating it from the rest of its paragraph - known as orphan
* Use a single space after punctuation in a sentence. Pay attention to the shape the rag creates to avoid undesired shapes/angles 
* Spacing matters. The closer things are together, the more the reader will assume a relationship exists between separate blocks of information 

10. Relax, it’s just type 
* Be bold or italic, never regular - this is not an actual rule. It is a way to govern your life. Now that you’ve learned the rules, break it 


###Chris and Milka’s critique Takeaways 
* Be intentional about spacing! Creating small, medium, and large white spaces creates good contrast. You don’t have to have the size of the space in order, mix it up! This helps create hierarchy. Also, make sure the size of the space is distinguishable. 
* If the text is left aligned and ragged right, you want to be aware of the length of the lines. It is best to have short and long lines alternate. 
* Our eyes usually go to the darkest element on the page. The darkest element is typically the most important. Then the second most important is not as dark and the least important is the lightest. You want to create a hierarchy and have the elements interact using different font weights.

## Lesson Notes
- Codepen of the website remake: https://codepen.io/lilianhabib/pen/MWGeZaE 
- This layout reminded me of one of the layouts in Chris and Milka’s critique. The S-bottle logo is positioned at the top left of the web page, which immediately catches the users' attention because it is the boldest element and it is positioned where the eyes are naturally drawn to. Then the eyes are drawn to the image and then the menu. I like that the elements force the users’ eyes to travel around the page. 

- The menu seems like it was positioned arbitrarily relative to the logo because it is neither positioned at the top, middle, or bottom of the logo area. But, was it supposed to be positioned relative to the logo? I think that if it was properly aligned with the logo, it would have created a better flow and symmetry. 

- Just below the menu is the second boldest element on the web page. The designer could have put “pure” in the first line, but that would have caused “water” to be a widow. 

- Under the bold text is a short paragraph. It looks pretty small in comparison to the text above it. I wonder if reducing the font size by half would have visually looked better. I think that the difference in font sizes is too significant and, therefore, there isn’t harmony between the two sets of text. 

- The font size for the contact button looks bigger than the paragraph, but that could be because it is in uppercase letters. 

- The space between the three main elements on the right side of the page isn’t equal, but it is close to being the same pixels. I believe they should have put the effort to make the space equal to create consistency. 

- In regards to space, I do see a difference between large, medium, and small. Milka talked about the importance of creating different lengths of space to create a dynamic layout. I like that the space isn’t positioned chronologically from small to large because otherwise, it wouldn’t seem natural. 

- I think that the contrast between the background colour and text could be better. It is difficult to read the white text on a light blue background. 


## conclusion / major takeaways? 
- Be intentional about spacing and constrast. Both work together to create cohesive. However, sometimes, the spacing won't make sense (i.e. spacing between elements are only a few pixels off) because spacing it created based on the length of the box/words/paragraph.

##Lesson 083: Visual Language Intro 

###Standup 
**Yesterday**
* Completed day 3 of TAD 
* Worked on researching and analyzing a website 

**Today**
* Post day 3 of TAD
* Finalize the research and employ exercise 
* Get started on today's lesson 

No blockers 

Have a great day! 

## Lesson Notes
**Website elements** 
* Name 
* Biography/About page 
* Links to projects 
* Links to different accounts  - LinkedIn, GitHub, substack, etc
* Menu linking to other pages such as about, contact, etc

* images/thumbnail of projects 
* Logo 
* Resume 
* Picture of yourself 


## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Style tiles are a great way to combine all of the elements for the website and present it to the client. It wouldn't be efficient to create an entire website for each iterations. 
* You want the client to be with you at every stage while designing a website 
* Creating different iterations increases client buy-ins - iteractions can easily be completed be done with style tiles

No blockers 

Have a great day! 

## Lesson Notes
* I didn’t know anything about Santa Fe, New Mexico. So when I Googled the location, I found some similarities between the photos. I collected the photos I really liked in affinity designer. I compared the photos and found that there’s a lot of beige/brown coloured architecture, so I wanted to incorporate that as it seems common in this area. After some time, I narrowed it down to two photos and decided to combine the photos in the red box into a postcard. I wanted to incorporate the photo of the gate because it gives a welcoming and warm feeling. I wanted to capture the beauty of Santa Fe by incorporating the coloured sky, trees, and architecture.  

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Design is fun!! 
* Letting go of my own expectations and letting the design just happen!

## 09.21.2022 
## Lesson 087: Store style tile  

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? I was originally creating documents with my notes and uploading them to GitHub, but after speaking with Derek, I have learned how to complete journals directly in GitHub, which is so much easier. I might have misunderstood the instructions. I also reviewed the standup resource again. Not sure what took me so long to adopt this framework, but I'll be formating these standups like this from now on. 
* What is something that was confusing? Or an idea you had? Navigating GitHub is still  confusing. I am still figuring out all of the buttons and options available. 
* Is there anything you need help with today? 
* Is there anything you are excited to learn? I am excited to explore some common UX patterns/components and make a style tile with some of these components. If there is time, I am hoping to learn about DeployBot. 

No blockers 

Have a great day! 

## Lesson Notes
* Today was a challenge day so no lesson notes. 
 
## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* I am beginning to see the value in brainstorming and researching. Typically, I get impatient and I start designing without having any goals or starting point. This often causes a lot of stress and frustration as I am deleting, adding, and rearranging things. In the past couple of design challenges, I opened the design programs not to design something but to brainstorm and gather some ideas. I personally think brainstorming and researching have led to some designs I was actually satisfied with, which might mean that design could be in my future. This doesn't mean I'll create amazing designs all the time. It just means that I'll be less anxious about design and can go into it with a clear mind. 



## 09.22.2022 
## Lesson 088: Symbol and Icon Exploration   

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? I learned how to set up DeployBot and connect it to GitHub and server. I also learned about common UX patterns among various websites and applied those patterns to a style tile for a company’a website 

* What is something that was confusing? In a one of the channels, Derek mentioned to "keep content and layout separate with components that are independent of the page structure (ie inner-columns)". What does it mean to “keep content and layout separate" and "independent of the page structure"? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? I am excited to learn about  and design symbols and icons that all fit together 

* Blockers: going to have limited access to the internet until Saturday. Also, Slack is being weird on my laptop, so might not be able to upload today’s lesson by end of day. 


## Lesson Notes
* I create a set of icons today. The words selected were not related, but I had to somehow create some cohesiveness between them. I decided to stick to a yellow and white colour theme and use mostly simple shapes to create the images.
* Midway through this assignment, doubt started to set in. I hadn't felt this in the past few challenges - I've been confident with every design step I've taken. I thought I was doing it wrong and I did not think that my icons represented the words at all. I put a stop to those thoughts right away and reminded myself that not every design decision it going to be a good one. If I did it wrong, then that is great! I'll post it, get feedback, and make the proper changes. Having this internal dialogue with myself about whether the assignment is good enough or if I am doing it right, is not the best approach. Always get help and opinion from others. Often, my thoughts are biased and not always entirely accurate. 
 
## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Ask for help and opinion about my work before scratching the entire design. There might be some value in creating something different. 


## 09.26.2022 
## Lesson 092: PHP Templates

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned over the weekend? The entire Friday and weekend was write off for me as I was getting back home. I did work on my site and finalize it, but I did not learn anything new.  

* What is something that was confusing? I did not find anything confusing  

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today, I am excited to get a better understanding of PHP templates and create a Mad Lib challenge. Also, I am hoping to finalize the others pages on my website. 

* Blockers: I am still trying to get my body back to a normal sleep schedule - it's been harder than I thought it would be. 


## Lesson Notes
* Delimiter: A character that marks the beginning or end of a unit of data. In PHP, I'll be using <?php?> to start and end PHP.
* Concatenation: combine or join together (ex: airplane/air-plane). In PHP, you'll be joining strings together. For example, grabbing a first and last name from a databse and smooshing them together to form a greeting. 
* PHP is like an HTML document with some PHP in it. It is like the style tag within an HTML.
* Inside the quotes are strings of different characters, symbols and numbers 
* We can complete math equations 
* We can assign references to the different strings  
* Other ways to comment PHP in a paragraph, so use PHP in HTML: 
		
		<?php echo $variable; ?> 

		<?=$variable?> 
  


 
## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Today was fun and confusing all at the same time. I enjoyed learning about PHP and seeing how it can be used. I created a MadLibs activity and used PHP to fill in the blanks. I wrote the paragraph in <?php ?> and used echo to push the code onto the webpage. Then I tried php in HTML. There are two ways to write PHP in HTML. I tried both and found that it was much easier than the PHP method. When I uploaded it to the server, that was when things got challening. I spent some time figuring it out andI couldn't. But with Derek's help, I did the process of elimination and removed the math equation and that seems to have fixed the issue! Bt also... take. things. slow. I need to pratice this. I don't know if it is  excitement or lack of patience or both. 




## 09.27.2022 
## Lesson 093: Control Flow

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned over the yesterday? Yesterday I learned more about PHP and completed a MadLibs challenge. I ran into a HTTP 500 error after uploading it to the server. It took a while to figure out, but got it to work. I praticed PHP before the day ended and ran into the same HTTP 500 error. I realized that I forgot a few semi-colons and quotations. I also finalized all of the pages for my site (except the resume page) and updated the server. 

* What is something that was confusing? I did not find anything confusing  

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today, I am excited go over some terms and dive into else, if, and elseif statments. I am also going to go over yesterday lesson again for more practice. 

* Blockers: None!

## Lesson Notes
* Today we practiced some PHP control flow statements (else, elseif, and if). It reminded me of JS when I was learning on my own. I did run into some HTTP 500 error because I was putting a condition on the last else statement. I put a conditioned on the if and elseif statements and echoed a comment for the last else statement.
* Key words 
* * Delimiter: A character or set of characters that separate some text from other text. A comma, tags, quotes
* * Keyword: a reserved word that the language and the interpreter have already defined. 
* * Statement: explicit instruction. A comman you write. When you use the assignment operator, do math, or concatenate some strings, you are writing statements. 
* * Operator: a symbol that tells the PHP interpreter to perform certain actions. 
* * Boolean: value is true or false. 

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* As I was practicing writing <?php echo $animal;?> and <?=$animal?> statements in paragraphs, I forgot the semi-colons again when assigning a value to the variable! Don't forget the semi-colon! Look over things carefully!! 


## 09.28.2022 
## Lesson 094: PHP Arrays and Objects + some HSL color

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned over the yesterday? Yesterday, I learned about else, elseif and else statements. I practiced it several times and learned that the else statement doesn't need a condition. When I did add one, it resulted in a HTTP 500 error. I went over the MadLibs activity again and I kept forgetting those semi-colons. Spent about 5-10 minutes figuring out what I was doing wrong. Practiced it several times more after that and I think I am getting the the hang of it, but I'm going to practice it again today. I also unexpectedly spent majority of my evening fixing my site. The menu and paragraph for two of the pages overflowed, while the others didn't (i.e. home and project page). Not sure why because I used the home page's html and css as a template for all of the pages. The navigation bar overflowing was most confusing. I went over the code line by line and it was exactly the same as the home page's. However, when I copied the nav css (from the home page) to the other page, it magically fixed the issue. I don't know if it was some sort of glitch. Also recently, my logo disappears and I see another logo. Only when I refresh the page several times, I see my original logo. Weird.

* What is something that was confusing? Other than the website issue, there are no confusions! 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today, I am excited to learn about some PHP arrays and objects and play around with HSL colour

* Blockers: None!

## Lesson Notes
* An array is a data structure to organize lists of things. It has an intrinsic order to it. 
* Instead of asscessing the array with numbers, you can write echo $cat["nameokeyvalue"];. 
* Arrays has an intrinsic order, so you need to called $example[2]. The list starts at 0. 
* The Value Song: 
* adding black to a colour creates a shade. 
* adding white to a colour creates a tint. 
* grey - when you mix white and black. Add grey to a colour and you create a tone 
* value is the lightness or darkness of colour of hue

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Major takeaway today is use only one CSS styles page for all web pages. Always remember quotations and commas, and symbols. 


## 09.29.2022 
## Lesson 095: Loops and Iteration

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned over the yesterday? Yesterday I learned about arrays and objects and HSL. I checked my site's colour contrast. I didn't pass with the original colours, but passed the second time around with different colours. I also combined all css style pages into one. Nothing looks broken so far!

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? I am looking forward to learning about loops and iteration. After meeting with Derek, I have a better understanding of how to navigate git. I will also be applying CSS variables to my css and completing some milstone PHP challenges. 

* Blockers: None!

## Lesson Notes
* There are so many things I've learned today! It's exciting. So if thre are 5 items in the $fruitArray ($fruitsArray = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherries", "Date", "Elderberry"]). Then I'll use 'foreach'. (foreach $fruitArray as $fruit) { echo "li" . $fruit . "/li"; }). So what this means is that for each item in the $fruitArray call it $fruit and then echo each $fruit item in a list. 
* I created a monster adoption website using PHP! But it was confusing! I need more practice. I need to study each section to understand it better. I also think formatting is another thing I need to master, but that will come with practice. 
## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* foreach statement will called each item/run a block of code for each item. It'll also identify each item as a new variable. Then it'll do what you ask it to do i.e. create a list.  
* Also! USE STYLE TILE TO TEST OUT IDEAS FIRST THEN CODE IT. 



## 09.30.2022 
## Lesson 096: PHP functions

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I learned about the foreach statement. The foreach statement will call each item and run a block of code for each item and do what you tell it to do (for example, create a list of each item). I also learned how to use PHP to create an entire website. It was pretty confusing at first, but I kept typing the same things over and it stuck. Still need more practice though. 

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? I am excited to learn about and practice writing PHP functions and look for some use-cases for PHP. 

* Blockers: None!

## Lesson Notes
* Scope: Very simple: PHP has function scope. That's the only kind of scope separator that exists in PHP. Variables inside a function are only available inside that function. Variables outside of functions are available anywhere outside of functions, but not inside any function. This means there's one special scope in PHP: the global scope. Any variable declared outside of any function is within this global scope. 
* So, the $variables floating around in the program are scoped to the whole project, and the $variables in each function body are scoped to their respective function. They can’t access each other’s stuff!
* Anything outside of a function is called the global scope.
* Anything inside of a function is called the function scope.
* When you are planning out the function, the various things that will be needed are called parameters.
* When you go to call and actually run the function, then the values you pass into those parameter slots are referred to as arguments.
*

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* Thinking about where PHP can be used has made me realize that PHP can be used in a lot of apps and websites. 




## 10.3.2022 
## Lesson 099: CatchUp Day 1 

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Saturday/Sunday I wasn't feeling well but I managed to go through the PHP warm-up and practice some PHP objects, arrays, templates, and functions. I also completed Saturday's reflection and thought about different ways PHP can be used. In a way, it helped me understand it better when I thought about from a real-world perspective. 

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I am excited to go over more milestone PHP challenges. The theme-challenge sounds interesting, so maybe I can do that today! I also want to take my one-a-day and recode it using PHP. Sounds intimidating but I feel like it might help all the PHP stuff stick if I can apply it to a personal project. I really like the monster PHP challenge for that reason. It combined everything I have learning into one project. Because we have been learning PHP in small chunks, my brain thinks of it as something unrelated. So when there is a project that combines everything I've been learning, I see the relationship between each and how it can be used together. 

* Blockers: I'm having these intrusive thoughts that I'd forget all the PHP I have learned in the last week. 

## Lesson Notes
* No lesson available today! 
* Day 1 of the theme challenge. Starting the challenge was a little overwhelming. I haven't done responsive layouts in about 2 weeks, so I was worried that I might have forgotten a couple of things. Thankfully, I used a boilerplate for my CSS and HTML so that helped save some time and jog my memory. I made changes to the boilerplate accordingly. I have done a few of these layouts and from what I have seen and done, it is always best to start with formatting the structure. I start with the header and move down. I also start with the smallest screen and adjust for a bigger screen using @media. The footer section was a bit more complex. I could have created a 2 by 2 grid with flex box but I decided to use display: grid. Grid was and still is tricky to navigate, but I decided to give it a try anyways. I set the grid columns and immediately had an issue. The issue didn't discourage me, if anything, it made me determine to find the solution. After about 5 minutes or so, the commas between the two values caused the issue! Those darn commas. Anyways, I finally finished step 1 - coding the structure and applying CSS.
## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* I was able to code my thing-a-day using PHP! Pretty cool and pretty proud of myself. It sounded like a huge task but got it done in a reasonable time!


## 10.4.2022 
## Lesson 0100: CatchUp Day 2

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday?  Yesterday, I attempted to recode my thing-a-day with PHP and it worked! Ran into some issues with the images not appearing but moved my php file to the same folder as the images and that fixed the issue. Overall it took a while, but I gained more confidence in PHP. I also spent some time going over the PHP challenges. I fixed an issue with my DeployBot and pe-projects folder. I started the layout challenge and finished the HTML and CSS. 

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I am looking forward to completing the layout challenge. I will spend some time making it responsive for the different screen sizes. I am hoping to get on a call with Derek today to go over the code. I really like Chanelle's idea of completing a write-up each day, so that is what I'm going to do! 

* Blockers: None! 


## Lesson Notes
* Theme Challenge Layout 
* Day 2 of the Theme Challenge. Yesterday I completed the HTML and CSS. Today I wanted to work on step 2 - making the site responsive. This look longer than expected because I kept having to make adjustments to the initial CSS. Lesson learned - make it responsive while coding the structure of the HTML. Before speaking with Derek, I looked over the code once more. I made sure the spacing made sense and the site was responsive. I ran into this weird issue with the inner-column of my footer. The box was condensed to the corner, which I have only seen happen when I do not make a custom element display: block. Stepped away from it for a while, refreshed the page and the issue was gone. Not sure what the issue was because I didn't change anything in the footer. I also completed my write-up for the challenge. Chatted with Derek, made some changes to my HTML, and then spent a good amount of time coding three sections of the page in PHP. Once that issue magically fixed itself. I chatted with Derek just to make sure my code was in good shape. I fixed my HTML structure so that my content elements such as <p> and <h3> were in a box (i.e. header>inner-column>module or section>inner-column>module or footer>inner-column>module). After making those HTML changes, I transferred things into Sublime and recoded the menu, article, and action sections using PHP. it was so daunting starting out with PHP. I did not know where or how to start. I went back to mini challenges I did throughout last week and I started with key:value pairs. From there everything slowly started to make sense. I showed Derek and removed all the "echo" and properly embedded PHP into HTML. I used the monsters adoption PHP to help. I'm getting more confident and starting to love PHP. I see everything as puzzle pieces. Anyways, on to day 3 - Research! 

## conclusion / major takeaways?

## 10.5.2022 
## Lesson 0101: Catch-up Day 3

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday?  Yesterday I finished making my layout responsive. It took me longer than I wanted. I had an issue with the inner-column of my footer. The box was condensed to the corner, which I have only seen happen when I do not make a custom element display: block. Stepped away from it for a while, refreshed the page and the issue was gone. I also completed my 2 write-ups for this challenge. Then chatted with Derek, made some changes to my HTML, and then spent a good amount of time coding the menu, call-to-action, and article section in PHP. It was nerve wracking at first because I did not know where to start, but after reviewing some of the mini challenges from last week, it helped push me in the right direction. 


* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? I am excited to research sites and gather some visual inspiration for my site. I might also start the style tile today if I feel ready to. 

* Blockers: No blockers :) 



## Lesson Notes
* Today is research day! Woo! Not my favourite part of a challenge, but it is a necessity and an important part of the design/development process. While looking through the list of industries to focus on, I felt drawn to the beauty industry. Anything beauty related typically isn't my forte, but I decided that maybe it might be good to step out of my comfort zone. Now the actual research part. Should I search for beauty websites? Or a specific product within beauty? I decided to keep it open-ended and search for beauty websites rather than for a specific product because there wasn't a specific beauty product that I was drawn to focus on. I landed on a website consisting of different beauty-related websites. I wasn't liking the way make-up related sites looked. It kinda reminded me a of a drop-shipping site. It was all very generic. However, I found that websites selling hair care and skin care product all gave a nice, simple, clean, and sophisticated look. They all looked unique but also similar to some degree. I gathered all the hair and skin care sites, took screenshots of the home and product page and organized them on Affinity Designer side-by-side. One of the biggest similarities I have noticed is the colour scheme. The websites I was really drawn to were ones with light/pastel colours. I guess light, cream, pastel colours are refreshing, youthful, clean, and natural, which aligns with what the beauty industry is trying to sell. All of the home pages had many sections. The sections showed a demonstration/talked about the benefits of the product, had pictures of before and after results, pictures of a product and reviews. In between the sections would be a row of the highest rated. This format is pretty popular among the websites I looked at and I think it works. Ultimately when looking for skin/hair care products, I want to know that it will work, so if seeing pictures of the results, a list of the benefits, and positive reviews as one of the first things users see, it creates a sense of confidence and ease for the buyer. Many of the product pages were pretty similar except for two that I think did well in keeping the simplicity consistent throughout the site. I have highlighted the two sites in a red box. Unlike the other product pages, these product sites were not bombarded with product description, ingredients, benefits, and all other details. These two sites separated all of the product information in a drop-down section/menu below the product. Other things that worked for me is the visual and written instruction on how to use the product instead of just written instructions. Also, some websites included their impact to the environment and how their product might even include natural ingredients from a local farm. 
* Some words/phrases that were common were: nourishing/natural ingredients, clean, effective, smooth, nourishes skin, last moisture, antioxidants, serum, natural, healthy, personalized, care, and customize.

## 10.6.2022 
## Lesson 0102: Catch-Up Day 4

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday?  Yesterday, I chose an industry and narrowed it down to hair care or skin care. I spent a good amount of time researching different website, taking screenshots, and organizing the images on Affinity Designer. I also chatted with Chanelle and exchanged our PHP code for the theme challenge. I completed my write-up for yesterday's task as well. I decided to take a break from practicing PHP just to let everything sink in. 

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I am looking forward to applying some of the patterns/features/designs I gathered yesterday to some style tiles. I want to practice some PHP and work on recoding a website to PHP. I'll also be meeting Chanelle today to discuss our PHP code. 

* Blockers: None! 


## Lesson Notes
*  Meeting with Chanelle about PHP theme challenge Notes 
* I really like how you separated the files into parts. I totally forgot to do that when I was coding things in PHP. 
* I think overall your PHP is more concise than mine. I think I add extra stuff that seems like it didn't need to be there. For example, your CTA php doesn't have $header = $action["header"]; etc whereas mine does. Yours worked without having to declare a new value to the header, paragraph and button. 
* Question: FOr your CTA, I am curious why you created $moduleTwo instead of just having $moduleOne. 
* For Article.php: It seems like we did something similar for the article section but like the call to action, I assigned a new value, but I like the way approach you took. 
* I also see that you included the link for the button in the afterward in the echo section instead of in the key:value pairs. Is there a reason why you chose to do that instead of a different way?
* Also, looking at your style sheet, it reminds me that I need to do better at formatting and cleaning up my stylesheet by removing anything unnecessary. 
* Overall, I think you did great. I definitely want to make some changes to mine after looking at yours. 
//separate into separate files 
* I learned a lot while talking to Chanelle. Our code were pretty similar, but there were some differences and we discussed those. I made changes to my file that is more aligned with her file structure/format. 


## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* I learned more about PHP today after reviewing Chanelle's php with her. Putting PHP in a separate file is another way to integrate PHP in HTML. 


## 10.7.2022 
## Lesson 0102: Catch-Up Day 5

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday?  Yesterday, I spent a good amount of time creating some style tiles and thinking about the colour combination, typefaces, and layout. I think I finalized on a style that creates the image I want the brand to have. I also had a good chat with Chanelle about our php site and I made changes to my file - i.e. I created separate files for each php section, formatted my style sheets, and tried to replicate the menu with php (with the space between sign-in). I haven't fixed the menu yet, but I will continue to do that today. 

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I am hoping to apply styles to my website. It is pretty exciting to see everything come together to create a complete website. I haven't been practicing PHP or haven't had the time/made the time to start converting another personal website to PHP. I am hoping that I can have time to do that today even if it is for 30 minutes. 

* Blockers: It is Thanksgiving weekend! There will be lots of food and house preparation and friends and family flying in, so I will be pretty busy this weekend/middle of next week. I won't be online as much (this weekend) but I'll try to get my challenge up with the styles before the end of the week.

## Lesson 0106: Catch-Up Day 7

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Over the weekend, I spent a lot of time with family and friends that I haven't seen in a while so I did not get a chance to do as much I originally wanted. However, towards the end of the night yesterday, I got a chance to add CSS to the site. I just need to add some images and finalize the details. I did look over the original files sent but didn't get a chance to look over the less complicated one. 

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I want to look over Derek's code and compare it to my code. I also hope to finish the CSS and post it. My current tile looks similar to the layout so if I have time today, I want to redo my style tile. 

* Blockers: None 

## Lesson Notes
* PHP CSS are put in separate files and each section of the website can get their own CSS file. But how do you organize your CSS files so that it makes sense?
* This theme challenge has had its challenges, especially today when I could only use CSS to change the visual design of the site. But it is nice to see how all these different files come together to create one site. It was confusing (and still is) to navigating between each and trying to determine it's connection from one file to another, however, I learned a lot passively as I was switching between both.

## 10.11.2022 
## Lesson 0107: Catch-Up Day 8

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I spent a good amount of time styling my site. Navigating the different files and trying to determine where to make the changes and where to add new styles was a little challenging. There were frustrating moments as well but I am happy with the results. 

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I want to review my site and see if there is anything I want to change. Yesterday was a long day so looking at it again today might spark some new ideas. Complete my last layout for my responsive layout garden and start converting a project to PHP.  

* Blockers: None 

## Lesson Notes
*  I ran into an issue where the graphic-diptych text overflowed into the next section where the screen size was the smallest. I removed the absolute and relative positioning and that seemed to fix the issue. 
* Coding php in separate files is actually a lot easier than I thought. I think that creating the files from scratch yourself makes it easier. I coded the about.html page to PHP and everything turned out well. I haven't separated the CSS yet.

* No major takeaways 


## 10.12.2022 
## Lesson 0108: Catch-Up Day 9

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I fixed the text content on my site because it was overflowing into the action section. I spent some time updating the links on my personal. And spent some time, working on my responsive layout. I also recoded my about page in PHP.

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I want to finish my theme challenge site.  

* Blockers: None 

## Lesson Notes
*  Why is my graphic diptych not showing up?
* Why can I not apply different images to my call-to-action section?

## Lesson 0109: Catch-Up Day 10

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I worked on my site. I had issues with images not/the wrong images appearing, but I think it just took a while to appear. I also changed the call-to-action section to include a product section. Ran into an issue where all the images were the same for the product section. 

* What is something that was confusing? 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I fixed the image issue. I didn't include the $thumbnail = $products["thumbnail"]. I want to replace all of the text with ones that align with the purpose of the site. I'm also meeting with Derek to go over my site and get feedback. 

* Blockers: None

## Lesson 0110: Catch-Up Day 11

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I spoke with Derek about my site and worked on a grid layout for my products. I created a new style tile based on the design feedback. I liked the way things looked on the tile and made changes to the colour and action and product section on my site.


* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I will create a logo and make changes to the header and footer. Hopefully I can finish the site today and get feedback. Also maybe meet with Alpha 5.

* Blockers: None 

## Lesson Notes
* Today I finalized my layout challenge. There were some challenges that took a while to solve that now looking back was not difficult. For example, I decided to have the product info appear on hover on larger screens and be kept as is on small screens. It just had to add the hover pseudo class on picture because the element was before the text content so that everything after the picture element will inherit the hover instructions. I also updated the copy with information that aligned with the site, added a favicon, updated the og:image, added info to the product image, updated the footer links, created icons, created and added the logo, added a banner, and reduced the height of the nav bar. Accomplished so many things! The time was well spent! I really liked the way the site turned out.

## Lesson 0111: Catch-Up Day 12

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I spent majority of the day finishing up my challenge and finalizing all the small details. It took some time adjusting the info on the product section to appear on hover on larger screens. Looking back, it was pretty easy to do but for some reason it just wasn’t clicking last night. Pretty happy with how the site turned out!


* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I want to update my goals page, work on my responsive layout, add the layout challenge to my projects page, and recode some of my site’s page/projects to PHP.
Have a great Saturday!

## Lesson 0113: Programming Exercises 

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I noticed an issue with the product section info. THe prouct info only appeared when I hovered over the image, but would disappear when I hovered over the "buy now" link. I spent some time figuring that out and it's now fixed. I also spent some time recoding my project page to PHP. Then I updated my goals page and worked on my responsive layout. I've been working on the same responsive layout for a while so I made some changes to the CSS and HTMl based on what I have learned. As I was making these changes, I suddenly realized how much I've learned. 


* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I want to complete the programming exercises and revist PHP terms and concepts from previous weeks. I am going to write things out to make all these PHP concepts stick instead of just typing the solution out on Sublime. It might take a little longer but I find that it helps. Then I'm hoping to get started on the first chapter of the book. Then, if I have the time I want start writing a substack article for this week.

## Lesson Notes
* Exercises for Programmers Book Notes - Added to notes 
* PHP is a server-side scripting language 
* It's primary purpose is to generate HTML. So when a web page renders, it is rendering the HTML that the PHP created
* PHP does not know anything about HTML. It just sees strings of characters. 
* PHP allows you to save things in memory. Then creates references to point to those things in memory so you can reference them later. 
* PHP runs top-down and eecutes in that order. 
* So a reference must be declared first or else calling that reference would break the code 
* Interpolation is adding variables in between strings
* Brances are optional, but if you are using array elements, you much use braces e.g.: $greeting = "Welcome, {$user['name']}!";. So as a standard, braces are used if variable interpolation is used, instead of concatenation. 
* Double quotes are required in interpolation

## Lesson 114: Thinking through problems with pseudo-code

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I read through Chapter 1 and made notes on it. There were quite a few things that resonated with me while reading this chapter. The first was how effective test-driven development and writing pesudocode was. Both are quick and easy and also provides an idea of the expected results and how one might achieve those results. I spent the rest of the day practicing early PHP concepts learned weeks ago and practiced some newers ones seen in the theme challenge. I did not get the chance to complete walkthrough part 3 because I wanted to make sure I was confident with the concepts in part 2. 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I am looking forward to reading Chapter 2 of Exercises for Programmers and practicing concepts from walthrough part 2 and going over walkthrough part 3. I started my substack article today, so I want to continue that today.

## Lesson 115: Intro to server-side forms

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I read through Chapter 2 and worked through the problems using pseudocode. Then I spent some time practicing walkthrough Part 1, 2, and 3. I was able to complete an example without referencing the lesson but definitely still need more practice. 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I am excited to get into forms. I experimented with making forms in the past, but I don't remember much, so it'll be nice to learn about it today and make one. I want to go over each of the PHP templating again. I hope to do this everyday until I feel completely confident in it. Also, excited to meet with everyone today! 

* Blockers: None 

## Lesson Notes
* Input is a self-closing tag - <input> instead of <input/> 
* To set the form up for PHP, each input gets a name and that is used as the key in the submitted Array of content
* "POST" means you are SENDING data instead of requesting it
* value attributes represents the data and the visual content as well. 
* ISSET() is a way to tell if the variable has been assigned/has a value other than NULL. In other words, it helped determine whether you have used a variable in your code or not before. 
* After you post/submit the form, the submitted data just hands around for you to use on the subsequent page visit. Like any other PHP associate array 
* HTML inputs (even number inputs) end up with "Strings" for values 
* Floatval(string) will turn the string into a float or a "floating-point integer". 
* integer is a positive or negative whole number and floats are numbers with decimals.

## Lesson 116: Practice Practice Practice 

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I had a really great meeting with alpha-5. We provided and gave feedback on each other's business card site and theme challenge. I also spent some time practicing forms and played around different types of input fields. Before ending the day, I went over php templating again and I've been feeling more confident with it. I was able to write everything out without referencing the lesson. 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I am looking forward to choosing an exercise from the book and planning out the exercise. I also want to finish up my substack article and implement the feedback from yesterday to my business card site and theme challenge and update pages on my site.

## Lesson 117: Another Exercises for Programmers practice day! 

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday I practiced forms and php templating. I am starting to feel more comfortable with both the more I practice. Then I implemented some of the feedback to my site and theme challenge. 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn? Today I want to spend some time learning about array_push() and reading over the documents on userful built-in functions. Then I want to do a couple more challenges from the book and try to incorporate some of the new functions. I am going to end the night with php templating and implementing the feedbak to my site and theme challenge. 

* Blockers: None 

## Lesson Notes
* array_push() is the function name 

* PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8 are versions of PHP that include array_push().

* array_push() pushes one more more elements onto th end of the array.

* array_push() treats array as a stack and pushes the passed variables onto the end of array. The length of array increases by the number of variables pushed. In other words: array_push() takes an existing array and adds another variable that has been passed onto the end of an array. 

* If you use array_() to add ONE element to the element, it's better to use $array[] = because there is no overhead of calling a function 

* array_push() will raise a warning if the first argument is not an array. This is different from the $var[] behaviour where a new array was created 

* array: the input array --> array & $array 

* values: the values to push onto the end of the array --> mixed.... $values

* return value: Returns the new number of elements in the array --> int 

* example # 1 array_push()
<?php 
  $stack = array ("orange", "banana"); 
  array_push($stack, "apple", "raspberry"); 
  print_r($stack); 
?>

* the above example will output: 
Array
(
  [0] => orange
  [1] => banana
  [2] => apple 
  [3] => raspberry 
)

* array_pop() - pop the element off the end of the array 

* array_shift() - Shift an element off the beginning of array 

* array_unshift() - prepend one or more elements to the beginning of an array 

* isset - determine if a variable is declared and is different than null 

* unset - unset a given variable, in other words, destroys the specified variables. But, the behaviour of unset inside of a function can vary depending on what type of variable you are attempting to destroy. If a globalized variable is unset() inside of a function, only the local variable is destroyed. The variable in the calling environment will retain the same value as before unset() was called. 

* strlen - get string length

* strrev - reverse a string --> "Hello World" to "!dlrow olleH"

* strtolower - make a string lowercase 

* round - rounds a float --> var_dump (round(3.4)); to float (3) 

* trim - strip whitespace (or other characters) from the beginning and end of a string 

* explode - split a string by a string 

* implode - join array elements with a string --> 
$a1 = array ('one', 'two', 'three'); 
$b1 = array ( '1st' => 'four', 'five', '3rd' => 'six' );
 implode (',', $a), '/', implode (',', $b);
 output: one, two, three / four, five, six 

* substr - return part of a string 
substr("abcdef", -1) // returns "f"
substr("abcdef", -2) //returns "ef" 
substr("abcdef", 1) //returns "b"
substr("abcdef", 0, -1); // returns "abcde" > negative offset will start at the end 
substr ("abcdef", 2, -1); removes "ab" and //return "cde"

* count - counts all elements in an array or in a countable object 
counts all elements in an array when used with an array. 
$a[0] = 1; 
$a[1] = 2;
$a[2] = 3; 
var_dump(count($a)); 
ouput int(3)  

* array_push - push one or more elements onto the end of array 
treats array as a stack, and pushes the passed variables onto the end of array. The length of array increases by the number of variables pushed. 

* array_rand - pick one or more random keys out of an array 

* array_reverse - return an array with elements in reverse order 
$input  = array("php", 4.0, array("green", "red"));
$reversed = array_reverse($input);
output: 
[2] => Array
        (
            [0] => green
            [1] => red
        )

    [1] => 4
    [0] => php

* array_slice - extract a slice of the array 
-offset parameter denotes the position in the array, not the key. 
-Offset is non-negative, the sequence will start at that offset and offset is negative, the sequence will start that far from the end of the array. 
-$input = array("a", "b", "c", "d", "e");
-$output = array_slice($input, 2);      // returns "c", "d", and "e"
-$output = array_slice($input, -2, 1);  // returns "d"
-$output = array_slice($input, 0, 3);   // returns "a", "b", and "c"

* array_unique - removes duplicate values from an array 
<?php
$input = array("a" => "green", "red", "b" => "green", "blue", "red");
$result = array_unique($input);
print_r($result);
?>
output:     
    [a] => green
    [0] => red
    [1] => blue

* date - format a unix timestamp 
$today = date("F j, Y, g:i a");                 // March 10, 2001, 5:16 pm
$today = date("m.d.y");                         // 03.10.01
$today = date("j, n, Y");                       // 10, 3, 2001
$today = date("Ymd");                           // 20010310
$today = date('h-i-s, j-m-y, it is w Day');     // 05-16-18, 10-03-01, 1631 1618 6 Satpm01
$today = date('\i\t \i\s \t\h\e jS \d\a\y.');   // it is the 10th day.
$today = date("D M j G:i:s T Y");               // Sat Mar 10 17:16:18 MST 2001
$today = date('H:m:s \m \i\s\ \m\o\n\t\h');     // 17:03:18 m is month
$today = date("H:i:s");                         // 17:16:18
$today = date("Y-m-d H:i:s");                   // 2001-03-


* mail - send mail 
mail(
    string $to,
    string $subject,
    string $message,
    array|string $additional_headers = [],
    string $additional_params = ""
): bool
-to: user@example.com
user@example.com, anotheruser@example.com
User <user@example.com>
User <user@example.com>, Another User <anotheruser@example.com>
-subject: subject of the email to be sent 
-message: Each line should be separated with a CRLF (\r\n). Lines should not be larger than 70 characters.
-additional-headers: string or array to be inserted at the end of the email header 
-additional_params: The additional_params parameter can be used to pass additional flags as command line options to the program configured to be used when sending mail, as defined by the sendmail_path configuration setting. 
$to      = 'nobody@example.com';
$subject = 'the subject';
$message = 'hello';
$headers = 'From: webmaster@example.com' . "\r\n" .
    'Reply-To: webmaster@example.com' . "\r\n" .
    'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion();
mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);

* Floatval(string) will turn the string into a float or a "floating-point integer". 
* integer is a positive or negative whole number and floats are numbers with decimals.

## Lesson 120: Routing with URL Querystrings

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Over the weekend, I did not get the chance to do as much as I wanted with forms and php templating because I got what I think was a stomach bug. I did edit my project page locally and removed some projects, but did not get the chance to edit the projects. I also went over a list of useful built-in functions and completed two more challenges. 

* Is there anything you are excited to learn?  Today am looking forward to learning about query strings and start thinking about and building my project. If I get the chance today, I want to go over the exercises for programmers part 1 video. I'll be going to the mainland tommorrow and spending the rest of the week there so today and tomorrow are going to be more busy than unusual, but I am going to be available as much as possible. 

* Blockers: None 

## Lesson Notes
* https://site.com?someKey=someValue
$thingYouCanUse=$ _ GET["someKey"];
* ? will signify the start of the querystring. The = will connect the pair. You can send many pairs by putting a & between each 
* When you post your form, it gets stored in the $ _ POST array. POST is used to collect form data after submitting a HTML form. 
* When you get a URL and send along some data, it gets stored in the $ _ GET array. 
* Project ideas: 
 -restaurant - vietnamese 
 -cat adoption site 
 -bc trip itinerary - hikes 
 -food itinerary - in toronto

## Lesson 122: CRUD: Database ideas and medley 

### Standup 
* What is one thing you learned yesterday? Yesterday  

* Is there anything you are excited to learn?  Today 
* Blockers: None

## Lesson Notes
* CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete 
* each piece of data that you want to store is referred to as a recor. It's a recording of the data. 
* To make the data exist, it can be done via button, a set of form fields or something automated. 
* Either way the record is created
* The system(?) would be reading the record submitted and maybe even displaying it. 
* If you want to update the address or name, this updating the record (the U in CRUD)
* And you can also delete the record if you are done with it. 
* JSON = Javascript Object Notation but in our case, it is just a slightly different version of PHP associative array 
* 

## conclusion / major takeaways? 
* App idea: an app that includes all the cafes that have wifi. It will include pictures and the type of amenities (plugs, bar stools), and even eventually tell you how many seats are avilable.
